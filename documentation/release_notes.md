## [Release 2.0](https://github.com/BenjaminHamon/JobOrchestra/releases/tag/release%2F2.0)

_Revision 9d4b6abb481f8589d72c761164932c3412463ff8 (3 May 2020)_

This release renames the project to Job Orchestra.

This is a large update, with breaking changes on a lot of interfaces and with the database, as well as large changes to the internal implementation.
New features include projects, project status, time based schedules, run source, automatic worker registration, real-time logs.
Master worker communication was reworked to be bidirectional and the task system was removed.
These changes make it so that the master is way more responsive, by assigning runs and receiving updates faster.

The project supports Python 3.5 and above. With Python 3.8, there are deprecation warnings related to asyncio.
